        <p>Wow -- what an episode! <i>Invincible</i> Season 3, Episode 7 throws us straight into the chaos of the <i>Invincible War</i>, and it does not hold back. This one's got everything: insane action, emotional gut punches, and some major story developments that set up the season finale perfectly.</p>
        
        <h3>Action and Story Execution</h3>

        <p>Right from the start, the episode dives into pure destruction as Angstrom Levy unleashes evil versions of Mark from different realities. The fights are intense, the animation is top-notch, and the scale of destruction is massive. It's easily one of the most visually stunning episodes so far.</p>
        <p>Then there's Rex Splode's big moment -- wow, that hit hard. His self-sacrifice was heartbreaking but also extremely epic, proving just how much he's grown as a character. It's one of those deaths that really sticks with you and makes the whole war feel even more real.</p>
        
        <h3>Character Moments and Themes</h3>

        <p>Despite all the action, the episode doesn't forget to give us some great character moments. Mark is dealing with a ton of guilt and pressure, and you can really feel the weight of everything he's been through. His scenes with Eve and Debbie add a lot of emotional depth, grounding the episode admist all the chaos.</p>
        <p>And then there's Conquest. Just wow. His introduction at the end was terrifying, and with Jeffrey Dean Morgan voicing him, you just know things are about to get even crazier. This guy is a serious threat, and the finale is going to be completely wild.</p>

        <h3>The Remaining Invincible Variants</h3>

          </figcaption>        
        </figure>
        <p>With so many versions of Mark unleashed, only eight remain standing after the chaos:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prisoner Mark</li>
          <li>Omni Mark</li>
          <li>Mohawk Mark</li>
          <li>Emperor Mark</li>
          <li>Phantom Mark</li>
          <li>Sinister Mark</li>
          <li>Unmasked Mark</li>
          <li>Viltrum Mark</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of them brings their own unique twist to the character, and it'll be interesting to see how (or if) they factor into the story moving forward. Some might align with Mark, while others could pose an even bigger threat. The war may be over, but their survival leaves plenty of room for future conflicts.</p>
